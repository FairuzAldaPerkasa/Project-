In this project, we are trying to make the experience of sailing for fishermen much **safer** and more **efficient**. We aim to provide you with practical data-driven solutions on your mobile phone. We will develop this project in stages!
Here is the initial project plan!  
- Build the initial application with an initial model that can provide basic recommendations based on weather data and tidal patterns at 1 location on the coast of Indonesia, namely the South Bali Sea. Note that we will expand the scope of this project with a larger dataset covering all waters in Indonesia.
- Build the model to cover every potential location across the Indonesian coast!, adding features to provide weather warnings, and optimal fishing schedules. We will also improve our first feature so that the information provided by our application will be more useful for you!.
-  Build the model to include factors such as fish species, fishing season, and sea conditions, and add a feature to allow you to share your experiences with our community coming soon feature.

## Installation
Apk file for app installation can be found on our latest release [here](https://github.com/FairuzAldaPerkasa/Project-Capstone/releases/tag/v1.0.0), under the [releases](https://github.com/FairuzAldaPerkasa/Project-Capstone/releases/) section. Please beware that this app require permission to allow realtime location.
